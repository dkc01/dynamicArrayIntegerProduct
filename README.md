This C++ program allows the user to input a list of integers of variable size. It dynamically allocates memory for an array to store the input integers. If the number of integers entered exceeds the initially allocated size of the array, the program dynamically resizes the array to accommodate the additional elements. Once all integers are input, the program calculates the product of all the integers in the array using a recursive function. Finally, it prints the result of the product.
